# Easy-Docs (Plain English)

**What is this?**  
A website that looks and behaves like an operating system. It changes “eras” over time:
- **Terminal-OS** → big retro terminal window
- **OS-91** → classic desktop with icons
- **Now-OS** → modern desktop with a dock and search

**Mobile:**  
- Terminal shows a simple **list** of apps.  
- OS-91 and Now-OS show **icon grids**.  
Tapping an app opens it **full-screen**.

**Apps:**  
- **Connect** lets you see friends, chat, and invite them to play.  
- **Arcade** has mini games (Pong, Snake, Tron).  
- **Dimension** is a 3D space that grows from a fun window → live wallpaper → shared multiplayer room.

**Countdown:**  
There’s a timer on the site. When it hits zero, the OS “reboots” into the next era.
