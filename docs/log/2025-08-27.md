# Daily Log — 2025-08-27

## Completed
- Finished Scaffold Chunk 4 (appRegistry + core apps wired in).
- Fixed missing app import errors (Projects, Gallery, Settings, Connect, Arcade, Dimension, Terminal).
- Added `VITE_FORCE_ERA` dev override to manually force UI era for testing.
- Confirmed Now-OS era appears in UI after forcing.
- Updated CHANGELOG.

## Issues
- Hot Module Reload (HMR) invalidation warnings for `appMeta` exports (not breaking; will need cleanup later).
- Forced era override works in console, but UI sync requires reload — noted for polish pass.

## Next
- Continue with Scaffold Chunk 5.
- Plan first polish/debug pass once all scaffolds are in.

## Additional
- Refactored apps to use split `meta.ts` files; removed inline `appMeta` from `index.tsx`.
- Updated `appRegistry` to import default components and named metas; HMR export warnings resolved.
- Desktop launcher and taskbar wired to WindowManager context for opening/focusing/minimizing windows.
- Started dev server to verify Framer Motion integration:
  - `VITE v5.4.19  ready in 298 ms`
  - Local: `http://localhost:5173/`
 
Chunk 5: Countdown + Era flip
- Added `src/shell/era/EraContext.tsx` as centralized era provider (schedule loader, tick, flip handling, dev override support).
- Implemented `src/components/CountdownBadge.tsx` and wired `RebootOverlay` into the app shell.
- Styles updated for badge and overlay; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
Commit: <pending>

Chunk 6: Recents + File Browser
- Added `src/services/recents.ts` (localStorage-backed recents) and `src/services/fileSystem.ts` (stub virtual FS).
- Implemented `Recents.EXE` and `File Browser.EXE` stubs; registered in `appRegistry`.
- Updated docs and styles for recents/file browser.
