# Daily Log — 2025-08-27

## Completed
- Finished Scaffold Chunk 4 (appRegistry + core apps wired in).
- Fixed missing app import errors (Projects, Gallery, Settings, Connect, Arcade, Dimension, Terminal).
- Added `VITE_FORCE_ERA` dev override to manually force UI era for testing.
- Confirmed Now-OS era appears in UI after forcing.
- Updated CHANGELOG.

## Issues
- Hot Module Reload (HMR) invalidation warnings for `appMeta` exports (not breaking; will need cleanup later).
- Forced era override works in console, but UI sync requires reload — noted for polish pass.

## Next
- Continue with Scaffold Chunk 5.
- Plan first polish/debug pass once all scaffolds are in.

## Additional
- Refactored apps to use split `meta.ts` files; removed inline `appMeta` from `index.tsx`.
- Updated `appRegistry` to import default components and named metas; HMR export warnings resolved.
- Desktop launcher and taskbar wired to WindowManager context for opening/focusing/minimizing windows.
- Started dev server to verify Framer Motion integration:
  - `VITE v5.4.19  ready in 298 ms`
  - Local: `http://localhost:5173/`
 
Chunk 5: Countdown + Era flip
- Added `src/shell/era/EraContext.tsx` as centralized era provider (schedule loader, tick, flip handling, dev override support).
- Implemented `src/components/CountdownBadge.tsx` and wired `RebootOverlay` into the app shell.
- Styles updated for badge and overlay; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
Commit: <pending>

Chunk 6: Recents + File Browser
- Added `src/services/recents.ts` (localStorage-backed recents) and `src/services/fileSystem.ts` (stub virtual FS).
- Implemented `Recents.EXE` and `File Browser.EXE` stubs; registered in `appRegistry`.
- Updated docs and styles for recents/file browser.
Commit: <pending>

Chunk 7: Settings & Theme tokens
- Added `Settings.EXE` with appearance/wallpaper/accessibility toggles; persists prefs to localStorage and applies body classes.
- Split tokens: `src/themes/tokens.css` and `src/themes/eraThemes.css` for base + era overrides.
- Wire preferences into `EraContext` and ensure mobile gesture toggle respects user prefs.
Commit: <pending>

Fixes
- Fixed Settings.EXE barrel export and appRegistry import so Settings opens on desktop and mobile. Added temporary debug log to confirm registry contents during dev. (Will remove debug log after verification.)

Chunk 8: Desktop home by era (polish)
- Implemented desktop icons grid for OS-91 and Now-OS eras; Terminal-OS desktop remains icon-less.
- Desktop icons are keyboard navigable (Arrow keys, Home/End, Enter to open, Esc to clear selection); double-click opens apps.
- Launcher gains `Ctrl/Cmd + Space` hotkey and initial focus when opened; Esc closes it.
- Taskbar buttons are keyboard reachable and expose `aria-pressed` for active windows.
Files touched: `src/shell/Desktop.tsx`, `src/shell/Launcher.tsx`, `src/shell/Taskbar.tsx`, `src/styles/index.css`, `docs/easy/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
Commit: <pending>

Chunk 9: Content loaders & seeds
- Added `src/services/content/{types.ts,loaders.ts}` and seed JSON files under `content/` for `projects`, `media`, and `lore`.
- Wired `About.EXE`, `Projects.EXE`, and `Gallery.EXE` to load and render the JSON content. Projects supports a client-side filter; Gallery renders accessible images with alt text.
Files touched: `src/services/content/*`, `src/apps/about/index.tsx`, `src/apps/projects/index.tsx`, `src/apps/gallery/index.tsx`, `content/*`, `docs/easy/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
