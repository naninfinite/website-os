# Daily Log — 2025-08-27

## Completed
- Finished Scaffold Chunk 4 (appRegistry + core apps wired in).
- Fixed missing app import errors (Projects, Gallery, Settings, Connect, Arcade, Dimension, Terminal).
- Added `VITE_FORCE_ERA` dev override to manually force UI era for testing.
- Confirmed Now-OS era appears in UI after forcing.
- Updated CHANGELOG.

## Issues
- Hot Module Reload (HMR) invalidation warnings for `appMeta` exports (not breaking; will need cleanup later).
- Forced era override works in console, but UI sync requires reload — noted for polish pass.

## Next
- Continue with Scaffold Chunk 5.
- Plan first polish/debug pass once all scaffolds are in.
