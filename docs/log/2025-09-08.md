### Updates
- Desktop: render Home underlay inside WindowManager; corrected z-index; added dev log
- VFS: add guarded debug logs and stable sorting (folders first, then files) in `list()`.
- FileMan.EXE: add cwd-change logs, Escape/Alt+Left up-nav, Cmd/Ctrl+1/2 view toggles.
- Tests: add localVfs persistence tests; vitest node env; add test:ci script
- FileMan.EXE v1: create folder, inline rename, delete, multi-select, keyboard shortcuts, status bar
 - Terminal-OS: copied OG tokens and applied Terminal-OS CSS overrides (window chrome, taskbar, desktop icons, terminal); class hooks wired; no logic changes
 - OG Baseline: added Landing (video/poster), AppShell CRT overlay, Desktop 2×2 panels, StatusBar clock; OG-only default; assets placeholders wired.

Files touched:
- `src/services/vfs/memoryVfs.ts`
- `src/apps/fileman/index.tsx`

Smoke test:
- Passed: open/list/cd/breadcrumb/keyboard ok.

### Updates
- Fixed Desktop Enter key crash by guarding openApp() when no icons are present.
- Added debug logs:
  - CountdownBadge: DEBUG_COUNT logs on mount/unmount and era/next changes.
  - HomeDashboard: DEBUG_HOME logs on Terminal/Dimension card clicks.

## Updates
- Wired Desktop Home panel (Terminal-OS): inline countdown + quick launch (Terminal.EXE, Dimension.EXE)
- CountdownBadge inline variant; added dev-only debug logs (mount/unmount, era/next change, refresh)
- HomeDashboard card click logs (Terminal/Dimension)
- Tests: engine DOM guards + node env; loaders warn on invalid payload; added test:ci
- Terminal arcade visuals: CRT pixel style with integer scaling; scanlines toggle (Settings)
- fix(desktop): layered Home under windows; added z-index classes
- fix(mobile): Terminal.EXE renders full-height with theme colors in mobile container

## Verification
- Desktop: inline countdown visible in Home header; clicking Terminal/Dimension opens windows and logs in dev console.
- Mobile: all apps available in Home list; launch via tap.
- `npm run test:ci` passes locally.
- FileMan: New Folder (Cmd/Ctrl+N), inline rename (F2), Delete (Del/Backspace with confirm), Enter opens, multi-select (Cmd/Ctrl click; Shift range). Status bar reflects counts.
 - Terminal-OS: 2px borders; square corners; taskbar height 28px; OG green/black; terminal prompt/caret and label spacing match OG.
 - OG Baseline: Landing CTA Enter transitions to Desktop; CRT overlay visible; StatusBar clock ticks; reduced-motion respected.

## Notes
- Desktop (Terminal-OS) intentionally hides app icons—this is by design and part of the era profile.
