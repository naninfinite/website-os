### Updates
- PR-4: VFS hardening (localVfs)
  - Added deterministic ID generation for VFS nodes and atomic write semantics with rollback on failure.
  - Strengthened `localVfs.reset()` to seed from `/public/content/vfs.json` with validation and fallback.
  - Tests: add CRUD, reset, atomic fallback, and id determinism tests for `localVfs`.
  - Notes: Created tests and updated `localVfs` implementation to ensure deterministic behavior in CI; see `src/services/vfs` for changes.
